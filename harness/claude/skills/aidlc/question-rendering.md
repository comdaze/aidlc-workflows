# Question Rendering — Claude Code harness annex

This file defines how THIS harness renders the structured questions that
`aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol.md` § "Structured questions" requires.
The protocol and stage files are harness-neutral: they say *present a
structured question* and carry a fenced ` ```question ` spec block. This annex
is the one place that binds that contract to a concrete mechanism.

## Never echo the spec (non-negotiable)

A ` ```question ` fenced block is **INPUT to the `AskUserQuestion` tool, never
output to render**. The orchestrator MUST translate every ` ```question ` spec
into an actual `AskUserQuestion` tool call, and MUST NEVER echo, print, paste,
or "quote back" the fenced block, or any of its field lines (`prompt:`,
`header:`, `multiSelect:`, `options:`, `label:`, `description:`), into the chat
transcript. The user must never see the raw fence; they see only the native
`AskUserQuestion` prompt.

Echoing the fence as literal text is a **protocol violation**, not a stylistic
choice. It:

- produces a non-interactive wall of text the user cannot click or select;
- loses the built-in "Other" escape hatch that `AskUserQuestion` provides;
- is inconsistent with every correct rendering elsewhere in the same session.

If you find yourself about to write a triple-backtick `question` block into your
reply, STOP: that content belongs inside an `AskUserQuestion` tool call, not in
the message body.

This applies to **every** structured-question site, with no exceptions:

- approval gates (every stage completion);
- the questions interaction-mode choice (Guide me / I'll edit the file / Chat);
- the ladder prompt (autonomy mode after the walking skeleton);
- halt-and-ask on Bolt failure (Retry / Skip / Abort);
- the §13 learnings gate (keep / heading / promote-to-team).

(The one place ` ```question ` fences legitimately appear as literal text is
documentation like THIS file and the stage-protocol, where the fence is being
described as an authoring spec, not presented to a user. Those illustrative
examples stay; the prohibition is about live orchestration turns.)

## Mechanism

On Claude Code, every structured question renders via the **`AskUserQuestion`
tool**: the fenced ` ```question ` spec is the input, the tool call is the
output, never the other way around. Map the spec fields 1:1:

| Spec field | AskUserQuestion field |
|------------|----------------------|
| `prompt` | `questions[0].question` |
| `header` | `questions[0].header` |
| `multiSelect` | `questions[0].multiSelect` |
| `options[].label` | `questions[0].options[].label` |
| `options[].description` | `questions[0].options[].description` |

Example — this spec:

```question
prompt: "[Stage Name] complete. How would you like to proceed?"
header: Approval
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: Approve
    description: Continue to [next stage]
  - label: Request Changes
    description: Provide revision feedback
```

renders as:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "[Stage Name] complete. How would you like to proceed?",
    header: "Approval",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Approve", description: "Continue to [next stage]" },
      { label: "Request Changes", description: "Provide revision feedback" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

## Harness-specific behaviors

- **Approval gate `[next stage]`**: on an approval question, render the
  `Continue to [next stage]` placeholder from the run-stage directive's
  `next_stage` field verbatim (e.g. `Continue to NFR Requirements`); render
  `Complete workflow` when `next_stage` is null. Never guess the next stage.
- **Batching limits**: max 4 questions per `AskUserQuestion` call, max 4
  options per question, and **at least 2 options per question**. For 5+
  options, split across multiple calls (options A-D, then E+); the questions
  file retains the full option set as the authoritative record. Never send a
  one-option call: the tool rejects it before the user can answer.
- **"Other" escape**: `AskUserQuestion` has a built-in "Other" option, always
  available — do NOT add an explicit Other option to the spec's options list
  for interactive batches. (Questions *files* still end every question with
  `X. Other (please specify)` per protocol §3 — the file format is
  harness-neutral.)
- **Answer capture**: the user's selection returns as the exact option label;
  record it verbatim (protocol: never summarize User Input).
- **Long prompts**: the question body renders at full terminal width and wraps
  gracefully (multi-line wrap verified on macOS before each release) — see
  `knowledge/aidlc-shared/worktree-info-schema.md` for the long-path fallback.
